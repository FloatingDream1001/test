With the continuous improvement of industry and quality of life, the earth's environment is getting worse and worse. In my opinion, human activities have a bad effect on the earth. Human activities, both direct and indirect, have affected the Earth, causing the sea level to rise rapidly in recent years, the human suffering from more and more strange diseases, and violent and frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
First, human activities directly affect the earth. Human large-scale exploitation and expansion of their territory, resulting in the loss of forests, and the production of a large number of domestic and industrial waste pollution. These human activities have a direct impact on the earth's environment.
Secondly, human activities affect the earth indirectly. In recent years, there have been serious natural disasters in many places, such as debris flow, volcanic eruption, rising temperature and so on. The homes that animals live on have disappeared and species have decreased. A large number of land and sea water pollution, resulting in genetic pollution of species. These are the indirect effects of human activities on the earth.
Last but not least, since our activities affect the earth's environment, we should reduce and protect it. Don't let the last drop of water become our tears, don't let the last oasis into a desert. Let's work together, hand in hand, to protect our home. Hopefully our influence will be good for Mother Earth.
